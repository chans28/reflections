When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want a remote repository :
1. when all of my work is finalized and I am pretty sure that there are minor bugs or no bugs
2. I want to share the code so someone else can make changes and reuse it
3. If I have a client I can make use of uploading my work to the client who has outsourced it to a third party freelancer. Hence he gets an update through the entire software development process.
